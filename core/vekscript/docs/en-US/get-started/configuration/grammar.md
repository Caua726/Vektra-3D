# 🧠 About VEKScript — The Core Language of Vektra

VEKScript is the scripting language at the heart of the Vektra platform. Built from the ground up in Rust, it was designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to learn — all while offering deep control over animations, 3D modeling behaviors, and visual logic.

Whether you're automating scenes, defining object behaviors, or creating complex animations, VEKScript gives you the power to bring your ideas to life with clarity and speed.

## 📜 Why VEKScript?

VEKScript was developed to solve a simple yet crucial problem:
How can we give creators more power and flexibility without overwhelming them with technical complexity?

By combining intuitive syntax with high-performance execution, VEKScript strikes a balance between simplicity and control — ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.

## 🛠️ Language Grammar & Syntax

Here’s what you can expect when writing in VEKScript:

- **Human-readable** syntax inspired by popular scripting languages.

- **Real-time interpretation:** No compilation required.

- **Built-in commands** for animation flow, transformations, object handling, physics triggers, and more.

- **Minimal boilerplate**, focused on getting things done with fewer lines.

### ✍️ **Example:**

```
object "Cube" {
    position: [0, 1, 0]
    animation {
        move.to([0, 5, 0], duration: 2s)
        rotate.y(360°, duration: 3s)
    }
}
```
